# Space-Archives
The Space Archives is an open-source game inspired by Space Invaders, made entirely in Python. However, unlike the original Space Invaders, in this game, each enemy is a file from your computer. When you defeat an enemy, one of the files is deleted. But don't worry, the game only detects files that are in the same folder as the game.
